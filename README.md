## Overview and Origin 

Microsoft is the world's largest software maker. The company, founded by **Bill Gates** and **Paul Allen** in 1975, is best known for its software products, including Microsoft Windows operating systems, the Microsoft Office suite, and the Internet Explorer web browser.

Inspired by the January cover of Popular Electronics magazine, friends Bill  and Paul started Microsoft – originally called Micro-Soft, for microprocessors and software—in order to produce software for the Altair 8800, an early personal computer

In 1980, the pair struck a deal to provide the operating system for IBM’s first personal computer. Microsoft released Windows in 1985, a year before moving its headquarters to *Redmond, Washington*. By the late 1980s, Microsoft was the world’s largest personal-computer software company.

Allen quit his job as a programmer in Boston and Gates left Harvard University, where he was a student, to focus on their new company, which was based in Albuquerque because the city was home to electronics firm MITS, maker of the Altair 8800. By the end of 1978, Microsoft’s sales topped more than $1 million. The company went on to license its MS-DOS operating system to IBM for its first personal computer, which debuted in 1981. Afterward, other computer companies started licensing MS-DOS, which had no graphical interface and required users to type in commands in order to open a program. In 1983, Allen departed Microsoft after being diagnosed with Hodgkin’s lymphoma; he was successfully treated for the disease and went on to pursue a variety of other business ventures.

In 1985, Microsoft released a new operating system, Windows, with a graphical user interface that included drop-down menus, scroll bars and other features. The following year, the company went public at 21/USD a share, raising $61 million. By the late 1980s, Microsoft had become the world’s biggest personal-computer software company, based on sales. In 1995, amidst skyrocketing purchases of personal computers for home and office use, Windows 95 made its debut. It included such innovations as the Start menu (TV commercials for Windows 95 featured the Rolling Stones singing “Start Me Up”) and 7 million copies of the new product were sold in the first five weeks. During the second half of the 1990s, Internet usage took off, and Microsoft introduced its web browser, Internet Explorer, in 1995.

In 1998, the U.S. Department of Justice and 20 state attorneys general charged Microsoft with violating antitrust laws by using its dominance to drive competitors out of business; in 2001, the company reached a settlement with the government that imposed restrictions on its corporate practices. Also in 2001, Microsoft joined the video-game market with the launch of its Xbox console. 

As of December 2023 Microsoft has a market cap of ==**$2.783 Trillion**==. This makes Microsoft the world's second most valuable company by market cap.
In January 2023 Microsoft invested 10 billion dollars on the start-up OPenAI

## Business activities

Microsoft business purpose is to empower every individual and every organization on the earth to accomplish more. This mission statement demonstrates that the company's focus is on empowering individuals and groups. The usability of the company's computer goods is used to accomplish this empowerment.

Microsoft operates in three core areas: productivity and business processes, intelligent cloud, and more personal computing. Each segment caters to different customer groups, allowing Microsoft to maintain a broad customer base. One of Microsoft's primary customer groups lies within the enterprise and business sector.

Economies of scale, the network effect, brand strength, intellectual property, and regulation can all contribute to competitive moats. Without these factors in place, competition from comparable products and services eventually erodes operating margins. This sustainability of advantage is hugely important for investors that follow the philosophies of Charlie Munger or Warren Buffett.

These competitive advantages illustrate how Microsoft operates globally with popular product suites such as Windows, Office, and Azure. The network effect, economies of scale, and strong branding all work in Microsoft's favor, but it operates in highly competitive markets that are changing at accelerating rates.

Microsoft has been investing in AI and more specifically in Generative AI. Generative AI uses vast amounts of data combined with massive computing power to enable users to create high-quality content — including articles, essays, images, videos and music. The technology also allows users to write software code.

The investment in Generative AI had allowed Microsoft to set up 365 Copilot,  which revolutionizes collaboration and takes advantage of AI to automate tasks such as writing, editing, and data visualization across Word, Excel, PowerPoint, Outlook, and Teams. Copilot also simplifies the creation of meeting summaries.


## Competitors - Top 5

### Google
Google is a strong competitor for Microsoft as they both compete in the enterprise solutions vertical. Google has its G Suite platform that includes apps like Gmail, Docs, and Drive, similar to Office 365.

It also provides business solutions such as Cloud Platform that include various other services like Google BigQuery, Data Studio, etc., along with an enterprise-level cloud infrastructure. Google is also aggressively pushing for the adoption of Chromebooks, which may pose a challenge to Microsoft’s Windows platform in the long run.

Google market’s Chrome as an alternative to Microsoft Windows in the desktop operating system segment. The OS incorporates features such as a cloud-based system for storing data and applications and new Web standards such as HTML5, which give it a unique position in the market.

Windows dominates the market with a 73 percent market share, followed by Google Chrome at 10.8% and Mac OS with 7.5 percent, according to data from Statista. However, in the Search Engine market, Google holds the largest market share with 88.52 percent, followed by Microsoft’s Bing at 5.63 percent, according to Oberlo.

Microsoft’s competitive advantage over Google lies in its enterprise market, as Google has not effectively penetrated this segment. However, it is gaining with an increasing focus on its enterprise portfolio.

### Amazon

Microsoft and Amazon compete in the Cloud segment with their respective offerings. It’s a fierce battle between Microsoft Azure and Amazon Web Services (AWS) as both works towards maintaining their dominance in this vertical. Both companies have made significant investments to increase their services’ capability, reliability, and functionality through strategic partnerships with technology giants.

The Cloud Infrastructure Service market share of Amazon Web Services (AWS) and Microsoft is at 31 percent and 22 percent, respectively, as of 2021, according to Statista. With this level of competition, there is an increased risk of pricing pressure in the industry.

Microsoft faces a threat from Amazon Web Services’ (AWS) rapid development and expansion in the cloud services market due to its large customer base and low prices. AWS has made it easy for enterprises to build secure hybrid clouds with its infrastructure as service offerings.

However, Microsoft invests heavily in R&D to ensure that its Azure cloud infrastructure is highly secure and reliable. This enables it to price higher than AWS for the same service offerings. But, with increasing investments by Amazon into the security segment, Microsoft may face pricing pressure in the future.

### Apple

Microsoft competes against Apple in the enterprise solutions, hardware, and mobile operating system market. The competition has intensified as both are trying to strengthen their hold on different markets.

Apple has strengthened its presence in the enterprise market with its iOS platform that powers iPhone, iPad, iPod, and Mac devices. The company aims to provide its users with seamless communication across different Apple devices and constantly adds new features to improve productivity.

As of July 2021, Apple’s iOS mobile operating system controlled 16.55 percent of the mobile operating system market share, whereas Microsoft Windows had a 30.2 percent market share. Microsoft’s hardware segment has also been facing stiff competition from Apple. This may translate into lower revenue for Microsoft as Apple will price its products competitively in the long run.

However, Microsoft is on track to introduce Windows 11 operating system with new devices and services such as Surface Pro X which competes directly with Apple’s MacBook Pro 16

### Salesforce

Salesforce is one of the biggest Microsoft competitors in the cloud with its client relationship management offerings. It offers a range of products across different industry verticals such as Sales, Service, Marketing, and Platform Cloud. Salesforce holds the largest market share with 19 percent in the CRM market, with Microsoft Dynamics holding a wavering 3-4 percent.

Salesforce CRM has a strong presence in the market, with more than 83 percent of the Fortune 500 companies using its solutions, of which it also ranks 137. The company reached $21.25 Billion in revenue in its 2021 fiscal year. Moreover, its cloud services are part of its Software-as-a-service (SaaS) offering that is gaining popularity in the market.

Salesforce captured a significant market share due to its user-friendly interface, easy setup process, and support for multiple platforms that do not require additional installation. It also partnered with several technology giants such as Amazon web services (AWS) to strengthen its offerings and add features to its existing products for a better customer experience.

Salesforce is gaining a competitive advantage by expanding its services to other market segments through acquisitions such as Slack’s $27.7 billion in 2020. The company has also differentiated itself from the competition by providing co-development opportunities with partners and competitors alike. Microsoft’s slower pace of innovation may result in its inability to keep up with Salesforce, which will erode its customer base over time.

### IBM

IBM is among the world’s leading enterprise cloud providers and has adopted a hybrid approach to data services. The company aims to deliver its solutions through multiple channels such as cloud-based offerings, on-premise solutions, and hybrid cloud platforms.

Its offerings include everything from analytics, big data, and business intelligence to mobile, cloud, cybersecurity, internet of things (IoT), and social media analytics solutions. IBM services span a wide range of retail, banking, healthcare, government agencies, etc.

Microsoft identifies IBM as a competitor in the artificial intelligence (AI) market due to its Cognitive Services offering, database, and business intelligence products.

Microsoft claims that its Azure platform caters to the needs of enterprises better than IBM, and it has captured a significant share of the global market due to its competitive pricing, flexible deployment options, and availability in more than 170 countries.

In 2018, Microsoft held the largest market share in IaaS Cloud Services with 15.5 percent, while IBM lagged with 1.8 percent.
